# Firebase Login System

Hi there! This is a simple firebase login system modified to be compatible with React V6. 

The AuthContext file is meant to be modular and compatible with databases other than Firebase.  

**Showcase:**

**Note: You will need to adjust the functions within AuthContext if you are not using Firebase.**

## PSA

You will need to edit the .env.local file with your own local dependancies to access your production and development database.
