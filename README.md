# Firebase Login System

Hi there! This is a simple firebase login system modified to be compatible with React V6. 

The AuthContext file is meant to be modular and compatible with different databases. 

**Note: You will need to adjust the functions within AuthContext if you are not using Firebase.**

## Installation

Edit the .env.local file with your own local dependancies to access your productiona and development database.
